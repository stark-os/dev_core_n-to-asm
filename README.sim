t1 Overview

p This compiler is meant to be \beasy to use\b as much as possible. \
Though not included in stark distributions by default, it is one of \
the \ucore\u development tools required to build Stark OS from scratch.




t1 Compatibility

t2 Target

l Here is all the requirement to \brun\b this compiler:
- Linux based OS
-
- Core SDL library, accessible at runtime
Available in \lmain Stark OS packs\lhttps://github.com/stark-os/main/-apps/latest/\l
-


t2 Build requirements

t1 Use

t2 Install

p If you have downloaded the compiler, you will have to extract it \
completely to see a directory containing: \mn-to-asm.elf\m. \
This is your ready-to-use application directory so make sure to keep \
it somewhere appropriate as long as you need it.

p Although you can directly use the compiler as is, I recommend to \
create a link to it somewhere among the directories of your \mPATH\m \
environment variable. That way, you will be able to access it as any \
other shell command:
"bash
#example on Stark OS system
ln --symbolic /MY/PATH/TO/n-to-asm.elf /usr/$USR/.cmd/n-to-asm
"
l Compiler is successfully installed.


t2 Usage

p Then, you can compile directly by giving some N files as argument:
" bash
n-to-asm prgm1.n,pgrm2.n
"
p Result will have the same name as the 1st given file, except for \
the extension that will be turned into \m.asm\m.

p Lots of options can be provided for different purposes. \
Check out the help menu for more information:
" bash
n-to-asm --help
"
l There you go.


t2 Uninstall

p To uninstall, you only have to remove the application directory \
you have used when installing. Also, if you created a link to access \
the compiler as a variable, you should remove it as well:
" bash
#using the same example on Stark OS system
rm /usr/$USR/.cmd/n-to-asm
"
l Compiler is successfully uninstalled.




t1 Build process

l To build the compiler yourself, simply run:
" bash
bld/build
"
p The resulting files generated are in the \mout/\m directory. \
You may find more than what is inside the downloadable package files. \
However, you should not have anything missing.

l Directory \mapp/\m gives you shortcuts to all executable result.

l Also, this compiler can be built directly under the ready-to-use \
stark package format (same as downloadable resources):
" bash
bld/build-pkg
"
l The resulting package is also in the \mout\m directory.
